Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value
of the data element is generated from a hash function.

Hash tables store key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.

A hash function is a function that takes input of a variable length sequence of bytes
and converts it to a fixed length sequence. Its a ony way cryptographic algorithm.
It ensures that the same input results in the same output, however going the other way
is practically impossible.

In Python, the dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables.
