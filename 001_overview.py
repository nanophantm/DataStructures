Linear Data Structures

- Array
    Sequential arrangement of data elements paired with the index of the data element
- Linked List
    Each data element contains a link to another element along with the data present in it
- Stack
    A data structure which follows only to specific order of operation (LIFO, FIFO)
-Queue
    Similar to a stack but the order of operation is only FIFO
-Matrix
    A two dimensional data structure in which the data element is referred by a pair of indices


Non Linear Data Structures

- Binary Tree
    It is a data structure where each data element can be connected to max two other
    data elements and it starts with a root node
- Heap
    A special case of tree data strcuture where the data in the parent node is either
    greater than or equal to the child notes or strictly less than its child nodes.
- Hash Table
    Made of arrays associated with each other using a hash function. It retrieves values using keys
    rather than index from a data element.
- Graph
    An arrangement of vertices and nodes where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links.


Python Specific Data Structures
- List
    Similar to an array with the exception that the data elements can be different data types. You can
    have both numeric and string data in a python list.

- Tuple
    Similar to lists but they are immutable

- Dictionary
    The dictionary contains key-value pairs as its data elements.
